Notes:
- Kyle from Amazon: How do we recognize where to apply ml?
	- What if our underlying data is bad? squirrelly?
		- I'd think we'd need to really clean that up
		- Garbage in/Garbage out is still an issue
	- Dividing up the problem - is that a thing?
		- Seems like there's dual usage
			- One set of ML that processes to generate data from raw data (maybe a bit of text recognition)
			- Prediction with that data: Use that data to predict outcomes
	- Continuing with David
		- He has a similar situation in trying to help companies manage data in documents that might be stored in dropbox or box (or some online storage tool)
		- Can you gleam knowledge out of those docs without having to read each one?  What can you do?
		- Does this like some kind of text classification?

More notes - note there was a guy named @agilecoffee in attendance - from the OC - and he was big on
