# The 1st hot take!

The Overnight Dynamic Change of a Smaller Team

A team just went through a dramatic change - from 12 members down to 7.  While the remaining team anticipated the negative effects of the change - the results of the actual change were for the better!

TODO... Finish

Pros and Cons of team changes

- benefits of semi-permanent teams
- 10-20% change vs 50%-70 change
- does it make sense to purposely change up teams?
- team dynamics change and team robustness
- purposeful changing teams might create more T-shaped (or M-shaped/graph-shaped) people vs specialists
- takes investment when people switch roles - are orgs willing to make that investment

Will changing who's on a team affect metrics?  It shouldn't. Metrics shouldn't be focused on a particular person.
