**The 1st lean coffee epiphan/hot take!**

Your team just went through a dramatic change - from 12 members down to 7.
While the remaining team anticipated the negative effects of a change - the
actual results were for the better!

So some change can be good, but it's not guaranteed.   You never want to force
change on a team, but natural changes can have some great benefits:

- Allows other team members to grow as they'll have more opportunity.
- Maybe the change could result in a more-optimal size.
- Promoting voluntary team changes can better grow your team members.

Pros/Cons/Thoughts on team change:

- You don't want too dramatic a change.  There's a benefits of "semi-permanent
  teams" that bring consistency from project to project.
- 10-20% change is usually much less distruptive than a 50%-70 change.
- Does it make sense to purposely change up teams?  Changing a team might make
  for more T-shape (or M-shaped, or graph-shaped) teammates - all of which might
  be more effective team members
- It does take investment for people to switch switch teams/roles - Orgs willing
  to make that investment should weight the costs/benefits

Will changing who's on a team affect metrics?  It shouldn't. Metrics shouldn't be focused on a particular person.
